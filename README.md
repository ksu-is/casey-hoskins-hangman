A hangman game using the pygame module. 

This project will feature all of the expected functionality of the hangman game as well as a difficulty level that will include easy, medium, and hard. Each difficulty will include words that are approprite for each level. At the moment, the expected difficulties will be as followed: Easy -> Words that are 5 to 7 letters. Medium -> words that are 8 - 10 letters. Hard -> word that are 11+ letters. If time permits, I will also add scoring and a high score area that is stored using the SQLite database.
